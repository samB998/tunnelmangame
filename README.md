My Contributions

In this project, I implemented key components of the game logic and actor system. Specifically, I wrote and tested the following files:

Actor.cpp / Actor.h – Implemented core actor classes including Tunnelman, Protesters (Regular and Hardcore), Boulder, Barrel, Gold, Sonar, Squirt, and WaterPool, with full game behaviors.

StudentWorld.cpp / StudentWorld.h – Built world initialization, game loop, actor management, object placement, pathfinding logic, and interaction handling.

report.txt – Documented design decisions, class responsibilities, and testing of gameplay features.

These contributions covered:

Core gameplay logic (player movement, digging, resource collection, and item usage).

Enemy AI using BFS pathfinding, line-of-sight detection, and event-driven actions.

Object-oriented system design with state management for actors and environmental objects.

Scoring, win conditions, and dynamic world updates each tick.
